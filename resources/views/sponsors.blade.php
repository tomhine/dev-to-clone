            <p>Forem is the <x-link.a href="https://github.com/forem/forem" class="underline">open source community
                    software</x-link.a> that powers DEV and other <x-link.a href="https://forem.com/discover"
                    class="underline">growing communities</x-link.a>.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold">Can I set up my own Forem community?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely. Forem provides a powerful and extensible way to engage with your community. Many
                developer-facing organizations are in the process of replacing (or supplementing) their closed and
                synchronous-first developer communities —typically on Slack/Discord — with the open and async-first
                Forem platform.</p>
            <p>Forem is also a great platform for organizing your private ambassador communities and even your internal
                teams.</p>
            <p>Check out our <x-link.a href="https://forem.com/get-started" class="underline">“Get Started”</x-link.a>
                page for more information on hosting yourself or getting going immediately with our Forem Cloud option.
